                        No one knows your industry like you do and staying focused on what you do best is essential. I may not always remember the difference between 
                        absorption and adsorption, a neutrino and a quark, or a laser cannon and a photon torpedo. I will always be there, however, to explain the difference 
                        between a complaint and cause of action, jurisdiction and venue, or arbitration and mediation. More importantly, you need an attorney who instinctively 
                        appreciates your need to get the deal done and can speed things up or slow things down appropriately, helping you avoid land mines along the way; an attorney 
                        who is cost sensitive but can bring in focused high heat, at a reasonable, controlled cost, when a competitor or adversary gets out of line; a closer who knows 
                        which legal issues to wave off to get to the bottom line and which issues must be the focus of negotiation. I have serviced a range of clients, from public agencies 
                        with budgets of several hundred millions of dollars per year to three-person startups and close to everything in between. The law is purposefully designed for successful                            businesses to use. It doesn’t need to be scary; it’s just another tool in your kit. I look forward to talking to you about how to get the most from the legal protections and
                        opportunities available to you and your company.<br><br>

                        You have worked diligently for a long time to create a product or become a subject matter expert and to build relationships with potential partners, customers
                        and suppliers. You have heard the stories time and again in the press and when you talk to others in your industry of a person or company with a creative solution to a legitimate need
                        who gets taken to the cleaners by a big corporation, seeing their dream swallowed up in someone else’s glory. Don’t be that person. Don’t be that company. Over almost 20 years, I have 
                        negotiated several hundred contracts with a combined value of several billions of dollars. No attorney can guarantee that you can always get everything you want in a contract or that 
                        there won’t be disagreements or rough patches. How those issues are addressed is largely a function of your leverage, the single most important component of the negotiation. You do, however, 
                        want an attorney who understands the best process for getting to “yes;” the importance of responsiveness and timing; the real legal issues that need to be focused on and, in rare cases, the right
                        situation and moment to walk away, either temporarily or permanently. At the most basic level, a contract is just an explanation of what parties on either side of a transaction are expecting so that
                        performance can be measured and issues with performance are addressed ahead of time to minimize any disputes and to get the job done or product delivered in a timely and cost-effective way. I look forward
                        to talking to you about how to use your current and prospective contracts to achieve your strategic business goals.<br><br>

                        In rare cases, despite your best efforts, you find yourself either holding a demand letter in your hand or feeling the need to write one to someone that has disappointed you. Few things
                        are as disheartening. The best outcome you can expect is to be made whole. A small law firm is not usually going to be your best choice to take your case all the way to the Supreme Court. An experienced litigator
                        can, however, help you put the situation in perspective, giving you best, worst and likely scenarios; advise you on additional legal tools in your kit that might help you avoid or mitigate the cost and inconvenience
                        of litigation; and connect you with trusted, specialized litigators, appropriate to the situation, to make sure that those on the other side understand both the seriousness of your resolve and your capacity to make
                        good on your plans. An experienced litigator can also give you a realistic appraisal of what you can expect your costs to be at various stages of litigation; help you focus your communications with your outside litigation
                        team to keep the focus on strategic business objectives, rather than litigation for its own sake and provide meaningful review of your litigation team’s bills to help ensure that you are maximizing the value of their services.
                        I have litigated for most of my career, before juries, judges and administrators in State and Federal courts and other venues. When evaluating how best to proceed through the litigation minefield, there is no substitute for having
                        someone by your side that knows what it’s like to stand before a jury or judge and cogently and powerfully explaining the rightness of your cause. I look forward to talking to you about how to turn a stressful litigation scenario into
                        a manageable opportunity to reset your business position to help advance your long term business goals.
